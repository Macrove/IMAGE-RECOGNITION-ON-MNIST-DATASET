# IMAGE-RECOGNITION-ON-MNIST-DATASET

This project was a code along exercise from the book Hands On Machine Learning by Aurelien Geron.
This project was special because of which I uploaded it here. It changed my understanding in very fundamental ways I approach to analyse the datasets. It aimed to understand various classifiers and importance of different error metrics for different datasets.
I enjoyed personally while working on this project as it showed me how something obvious as accuracy can be a wrong error metric for most of the real world scenarios out there.
